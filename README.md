BMI Calculator: A Health Tracking Android Application

The BMI Calculator project aims to develop an Android application that assists users in determining their Body Mass Index (BMI) and provides a comprehensive health tracking solution. The application enables users to assess their weight status, whether they are healthy, overweight, or underweight, and allows them to maintain a history of their measurements for easy tracking. By utilizing shared preferences, the application ensures that user data is persistently stored even if the application is closed. Maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for overall well-being. The BMI Calculator application provides a user-friendly interface that allows individuals to calculate their BMI and monitor their progress over time. In addition to providing instant feedback on weight status, the application stores user data to enable effective tracking and analysis.

Features:
1. BMI Calculation: The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their height and weight. It calculates the BMI based on these inputs using the formula: BMI = weight(kg) / (height(m))^2.

2. Weight Status Assessment: Based on the calculated BMI, the application categorizes the user's weight status into three categories: healthy, overweight, or underweight. This information is presented in a clear and easily understandable format.

3. User History: The application enables users to maintain a history of their BMI calculations. Each time a user performs a calculation, the result is stored along with the date and time. This feature allows users to track their progress and make informed decisions regarding their health goals.

4. Persistent Data Storage: To ensure data integrity and longevity, the application utilizes shared preferences to store user data. Even if the application is closed or the device is restarted, the stored data remains intact. This feature guarantees a seamless user experience and uninterrupted health tracking.

5. User-Friendly Interface: The application incorporates a visually appealing and user-friendly design to enhance the overall user experience. The interface provides clear instructions for inputting data and offers intuitive navigation options for accessing historical data and viewing weight status information.

Conclusion:
The BMI Calculator project aims to develop an Android application that assists users in determining their BMI and tracking their weight status over time. By providing instant feedback and storing user data using shared preferences, the application empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their health and adopt healthier lifestyles. The project not only offers a valuable tool for personal health management but also serves as a platform for raising awareness about the importance of maintaining a healthy weight.
